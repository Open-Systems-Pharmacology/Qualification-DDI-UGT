This qualification report evaluates the predictive performance of the open systems pharmacology (OSP) suite to predict UGT1A1- and UGT1A9-mediated drug-drug interactions.

The qualification report demonstrates the level of confidence of the OSP suite with regard to
reliable PBPK predictions of inhibition of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 by selected perpetrators on sensitive substrates by means of pre-specified qualification measures. The presented PBPK models as well as the respective qualification plan and qualification report are transparently documented and provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Qualification-DDI-UGT).

Descriptions and evaluations of the included models are documented separately in the respective model repositories.

Please refer to the [Appendix](#5 Appendix) to learn more details:

- An overview over the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite is given in chapter [Section 5.1](#5.1 Open Systems Pharmacology Suite (OSPS) Introduction)
- [Section 5.2](#5.2 Mathematical Implementation of Drug-Drug Interactions) shows the implementation of the underlying mathematical equations for drug-drug interactions in the OSP suite.
- A detailed general description of the performed qualification workflow can be found in chapter [Section 5.3](#5.3 Automatic (re)-qualification workflow).
