This qualification report evaluates the predictive performance of the open systems pharmacology (OSP) suite to predict UGT1A1 and UGT1A9-mediated drug-drug interactions.

The qualification report demonstrates the level of confidence of the OSP suite with regard to
reliable PBPK predictions of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9-mediated DDIs by means of pre-specified
qualification measures. The presented PBPK models as well as the respective qualification plan and qualification report are transparently documented and provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Qualification-DDI-UGT)
