# Qualification-DDI-UGT-Inhibition

This repository contains a **qualification plan** (*qualification_plan.json*) including references to respective model snapshots and static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) to produce a **qualification report** evaluating the ability to perform simulations with the intended purpose to predict UGT1A1- and UGT1A9-mediated *inhibition* drug-drug interactions (**DDI**) of the PBPK platform **PK-Sim** (as part of the open systems pharmacology (OSP) suite) .

The latest release of the qualification plan and the static content can be found [here](../../releases/latest).

**The latest release of the qualification report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-Qualification-Reports/releases/latest).**

To demonstrate the level of confidence the predictive performance of the platform for this indented purpose is assessed particularly for **inhibition** of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 by selected perpetrators on sensitive substrates. All PBPK models represent whole-body PBPK models, which allow dynamic DDI simulations in organs expressing UGT1A1 or UGT1A9, respectively.
